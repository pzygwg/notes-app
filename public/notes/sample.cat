# This is a Sample Note

Just demonstrating that you can create multiple .cat files in this folder.

When you create notes in the app, they'll appear here as .cat files too.

## Code Example
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

You can include code blocks in your notes!
